# What is this project?

This is a tinder version for movies, but the movies don't need to match you back.
You choose what movies you would like to see, seen, or you didn't like/ don't want to see.
Then when you select your likings, you can see them on the Liked/Seen/Disliked page.
And if you click on the movie a title and description will be provided to you.

# Problem 

The problem is that we sometimes waste too much time on looking for movies to watch.

# Solution 

Matcher helps you make your life easier by saving all the movies and Tv shows in one place so when you are about to watch something with your firends
